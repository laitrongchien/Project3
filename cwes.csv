63e76e42e7ec9a5bef1df1f1,CWE-470,Use of Externally-Controlled Input to Select Classes or Code ('Unsafe Reflection'),"The application uses external input with reflection to select which classes or code to use, but it does not sufficiently prevent the input from selecting improper classes or code."
63e76e42e7ec9a5bef1df1f2,CWE-798,Use of Hard-coded Credentials,"The software contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key, which it uses for its own inbound authentication, outbound communication to external components, or encryption of internal data."
63e76e42e7ec9a5bef1df1f3,CWE-706,Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference,"The software uses a name or reference to access a resource, but the name/reference resolves to a resource that is outside of the intended control sphere."
63e76e42e7ec9a5bef1df1f4,CWE-330,Use of Insufficiently Random Values,The software uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.
63e76e42e7ec9a5bef1df1f5,CWE-916,Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort,"The software generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive."
63e76e42e7ec9a5bef1df1f6,CWE-908,Use of Uninitialized Resource,The software uses or accesses a resource that has not been initialized.
63e76e42e7ec9a5bef1df1f7,CWE-640,Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password,"The software contains a mechanism for users to recover or change their passwords without knowing the original password, but the mechanism is weak."
63e76e42e7ec9a5bef1df1f8,CWE-521,Weak Password Requirements,"The product does not require that users should have strong passwords, which makes it easier for attackers to compromise user accounts."
63e76e42e7ec9a5bef1df1f9,CWE-91,XML Injection (aka Blind XPath Injection),"The software does not properly neutralize special elements that are used in XML, allowing attackers to modify the syntax, content, or commands of the XML before it is processed by an end system."
